[WARNING: The following post contains ridiculous amounts of profanity. Although there is some parody to make a point, I have unfortunately actually heard people talk like this as a matter of course.]

Many people believe the increasingly excessive profanity pouring forth from Hollywood is manufactured. However, their daily lives are so profane that they have literally forgotten how to speak intelligently and use swear words as fillers all the time. So in reality, they actually work hard to cut down on the profanity they employ and are befuddled when their audience is still shocked. Plus, they aren't even that creative in varying their use of swearing and tend to stick to the most graphic words they can find and use that for pretty much everything.

- Human nature to go to the limit
- Vicious cycle

The following is what a development meeting might look like:

"What the fuck is that last fucking line again?"

"It fucking goes: 'Fuck you, fucking fuckface fuck fuckers who fuck!'"

"Fuck, so these fucking motherfuckers out there are so fucking pretentious that they fucking complain all the fucking time. So we fucking need to fucking adapt to their fucking closed-fucking-mindedness. So how fucking about: 'Fuck you, fucking fuckface fuckers who fuck!'? (That fucking first 'fuck' is fucking implied so we'll fucking compromise I fucking guess.)"

"Fucking whatever. If that'll fucking make them fucking happy, I fucking don't give a fuck. But fuck! So fucking much for fucking art fucking mirroring fucking reality."
